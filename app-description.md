Informations at a glance

Open the app and our user friendly dashboard will show you the latest balance and the value of your assets. Scroll down and you get to check all your latest transactions in one place. 


Transfer and store easily

You can transfer tokens straight from your dashboard, just touch any of your assets cards and you can start sending and receiving right away. Or use the QR scanner to help you.


Keeping you safe

Your tokens are safely stored in the blockchain and you can control them via the private key, which is safely stored encrypted in the operating system keychain. That means that nobody will be able to steal your tokens if they don't have access to the actual device and your password at the same time.
